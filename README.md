The idea is to create a solution that can help users transfer data from Mobile Phones to their computers, as easily as they can

Right now:

We create a server using ngrok on the PC, then tranfer files to that server. This currently handles Photos and Videos, and has some code that still needs working on. But as Ngrok server is based on internet, 
it acutally works well.
The PC backend is created with python libraries, and is a simple script file present.
